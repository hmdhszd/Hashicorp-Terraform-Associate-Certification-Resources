### The Dynamic Blocks and Splat Expressions example shows how multiple blocks of the same type can be dynamically created with a single dynamic block

### and then referred to in an output using the generalized splat expression.

### The input to the dynamic block is a variable of type list

You can dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks using which special block type: `Dynamic` `Block`

overuse of Dynamic Blocks, can make the configuration hard to read and maintain.

Can we use dynamic blocks to generate meta-argument blocks such as lifecycle and provisioner blocks?  FALSE


A dynamic block can only generate arguments that belong to the resource type, data source, provider, or provisioner being configured.

It is not possible to generate meta-argument blocks such as lifecycle and provisioner blocks, since Terraform must process these before it is safe to evaluate expressions.

Which nested argument defines the body of each generated block under dynamic block?  content


__________________________________________________________________________________________




Is it possible to declare the dynamic block inside another dynamic block?  YES



Some providers define resource types that include multiple levels of blocks nested inside one another. You can generate these nested structures dynamically when necessary by nesting dynamic blocks in the content portion of other dynamic blocks.
